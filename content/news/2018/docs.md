The documentation is now published on
[https://docs.helfertool.org/](https://docs.helfertool.org/).

It contains a section about the deployment of Helfertool that is more detailed
than the previous
[README](https://github.com/helfertool/helfertool/blob/master/README.md) file.
The README now only contains the instructions to setup a development
environment.

Some parts are still missing, but the important information should be there.
Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/helfertool/helfertool/issues)
or [pull request](https://github.com/helfertool/helfertool/pulls) with
improvements!
